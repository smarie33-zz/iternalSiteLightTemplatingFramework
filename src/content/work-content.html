								"heading" : "Recommendations for a GBS Turnaround",
								"problem" : "One of IBM’s sectors was contracting and facing a market shift from very large, long term program contracts to more discrete contracts with the need for continuous selling. IBM was losing share, fueled by declining top line revenue and costly investments in Infrastructure and Cloud.",
								"approach" : "A multi-pronged root cause assessment was conducted that focused on an exhaustive analysis of historical data, including market, opportunity, revenue and signings. SCIP also conducted stakeholder interviews with both internal and external clients.",
								"result" : "SCIP, in coordination with Corporate Strategy, recommended options to optimize the sector by segmenting the market, growing overall revenue and resulting PTI. The recommendations focused on account segmentation and proposed targeted strategies for rebuilding business development to increase pipeline and win rate. "

								"heading" : "Monitoring & Evaluation of Citizenship Efforts",
								"problem" : "IBM Citizenship (CC&CA) drives a significant portfolio of philanthropic offerings each year, including service-based grants to non-profit partners around the world. However, they lack robust systems and processes to effectively measure the impact of these efforts, and struggle to create compelling case studies for various internal and external storytelling purposes.",
								"approach" : "SCIP engaged with CC&CA to develop a global M&E framework and approach to gain insights about the impact that IBM is making through its Impact Grants program. Interviews were conducted with global team members and a framework was developed to allow CC&CA to transform its understanding of grant impact.",
								"result" : "The Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework is enabled by a set of streamlined processes and an inventory of metrics that will surface insights about operational effectiveness and partner impact. Tools were identified as a critical success factor, and work was initiated to migrate all regions to an enhanced, globally consistent database. These outcomes have positioned CC&CA for stronger reporting and storytelling capabilities about IBM’s important work in our communities."

								"heading" : "Thought Leadership for IBM Business Model Reinvention",
								"problem" : "IBM’s technology competitors such as Google and Amazon, who traditionally focused on consumer markets, are beginning to encroach on IBM's traditional enterprise markets. Combined with the digital disruption of industries by cloud, cognitive, and other emerging technologies, IBM is asking: "Is it time to introduce a new, disruptive IBM business model?"  If so, what kinds of business models do successful technology leaders have and how can that be leveraged at IBM?",
								"approach" : "SCIP conducted a deep analysis of key competitors and industry trends, and identified "platform businesses" as a key business model. The team developed a strategic framework to map out its components and structure, and developed targeted recommendations IBM based on its strategic assets, market position, and growth potential.",
								"result" : "SCIP provided the client with in-depth analyses and thought leadership on the success of platform business models and potential areas where IBM could establish competitive advantage. This has led to additional engagements, as the team begins to vet potential platform business models for IBM through continued analysis and engagement of senior leaders."

							{
								"heading" : "Mobile App to Generate Deeper Client Insights",
								"problem" : "IBM sellers are overwhelmed with information and lack the time and skills to develop deep client insights from data. This results in prospect meetings where sellers miss opportunities to discuss key areas of account growth, due to lack of information about the client’s needs.",
								"approach" : "SCIP validated IBM sellers’ pain points through interviews and buyer journey maps. The team secured IBM development resources and managed the construction of a mobile app targeted at alleviating these pain points. To generate more provocative insights for sellers, a second SCIP built a predictive model to recommend product and solutions by client. The teams defined a communications plan to engage senior IBM stakeholders, and build awareness, education and support across target audiences.",
								"result" : "The Client Expansion Mobile App addresses seller needs by providing client intelligence and opportunity identification to enable smarter sales conversations through data-driven insights. To date, the iOS application has been deployed to 17K IBM sellers, and is in the process of being deployed to an additional ~21K IBM users."

								"heading" : "Social Listening to Generate New Leads",
								"problem" : "GTS recognized a fundamental shift in its customers’ buying behavior and sought SCIP’s guidance on how to use digital to proactively discover new clients, and how to programmatically engage them at scale.",
								"approach" : "SCIP tested the hypothesis that IBM’s clients have conversations on Twitter that capture their pain points and express a need for GTS services. The team defined a set of target keywords to capture these conversations and fed them through an advanced analytics engine to generate a list of prospects. The team then served GTS ads on the Twitter feeds of these prospects, based on the assumption that they would have a higher click-through rate than current GTS targeting.",
								"result" : "Within a two-month engagement, SCIP identified 300K net-new prospects with real-time interest in GTS services and drove 20K leads to Marketplace site through paid social campaigns. Given the higher click-through rates, the effort outperformed the IBM paid social benchmark by 5x at a 85% cost reduction and passed 2K ‘hot’ prospects directly to 20 sellers. SCIP designed a repeatable process to scale, which is currently being explored in other IBM business units."

								"heading" : "Marketing Services Centers",
								"problem" : "Digital Services Group (DSG) needed to streamline work processes and optimize its resource model, to continue to create and optimize innovative campaigns, content and programs that deliver outstanding marketing results. DSG engaged SCIP to advise on the organizational design, and drive implementation and communication of the new model.",
								"approach" : "SCIP worked with DSG to stand up and operationalize centralized CoEs based on functions, to provide best in class capabilities, talent, efficiency, standards and innovation. The team conducted working sessions to define the mission, capabilities and resources within each Center, and developed an engagement model that aligned to One Center strategy.",
								"result" : "With SCIP’s support, the Centers of Excellence were established across a defined set of locations, and align directly to the marketing disciplines. The model is now better aligned to the New Work of Marketing, and serves as the primary execution arm of Marketing Diamond Teams. Work is still underway to measure the impact, including higher productivity and improved quality of outputs."

								"heading" : "Crowdfunding to Source Top Talent",
								"problem" : "IBM GBS was thinking about the future of the consulting business model, and exploring ways to deliver services in faster and more cost-effective ways to our clients. GBS leaders recognize that the consulting industry is moving away from large scale, multi-year deals, and towards outcome-centric delivery in a more agile, modular based approach.",
								"approach" : "SCIP focused on the industry shift from owned resources to variable labor and designed a solution to finding top talent without the constraints of traditional consulting, such as staffing availability. The BringIt Crowdsourcing Platform was built using Agile methodology. The team identified a single use case and built an initial prototype for alpha users within six weeks.",
								"result" : "In Agile fashion, the product is continually evolving based on user feedback and additional use case identification. The SCIP and GBS teams have engaged additional stakeholders and user groups to understand additional applications. To date, about 3k users have logged onto BringIt, and adoption is continuing to grow across IBM."
