# IBM-Studios

To Install: 

1) From the command line, in the project main folder, run 'npm install'. 

2) Run 'gulp'. You should get a browser window with the public default homepage.

3) Browser-Sync serves pages from the build/ folder. Modifying ANY file in the source directory should trigger a file-specific build / copy / browser refresh sequence. 

4) Browser-sync's default port is 3000. It will increment the port number if anything is already running on port 3000. Some initial browser paths, with this default port number, could be: 

  - http://localhost:3000/index.html
